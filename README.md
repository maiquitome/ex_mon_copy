## üéÆ Game explanation
* Turn based game where we will have a human against the computer;
* At the start of the game, the human will be able to choose his character's name, as well as the name of his 3 moves.
* Human and computer start with 100 life points;
* Each round, each can do one of 3 moves:
  - Average attack causing between (18-25) damage;
  - Random attack causing between (10-35) damage;
  - Healing power, healing between (18-25) of life.
* At each movement, the screen should display what happened and the situation of each player;
* If you or the computer have 0 life left, the game ends:
  - If someone loses, when displaying the result, it should not be displayed that any player was left with negative life.
